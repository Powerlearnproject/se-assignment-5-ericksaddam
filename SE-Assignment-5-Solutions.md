Once opened, you can type commands as you would in any terminal.
You can create multiple terminal instances and switch between them.
Split the terminal view horizontally or vertically using the split button.
Use the dropdown to switch between different shell types (e.g., PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash).

Advantages of using the integrated terminal:

Convenience: No need to switch between applications; everything is in one window.
Quick access to project-specific commands and environments.

Context awareness: The terminal automatically opens in your project's root directory.
Easy to run project-specific scripts and commands.

Multiple instances: Create and manage multiple terminals within the same window.
Useful for running different processes simultaneously (e.g., server, build tools).

Integration with tasks: Can be used to run VS Code tasks defined in tasks.json.
Customization: Customize font, colors, and other settings directly in VS Code settings.
